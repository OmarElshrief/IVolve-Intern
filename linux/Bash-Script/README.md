## Shell Scripring Basics
Create a shell script that would ping every single server in ip addresses range.

### Usage
1. clone the repository or download the `Ping-Bash.sh` script to your local machine.
2. Make script executable :
    ```sh
    chmod +x Ping-Bash.sh
    ```
3. Run the script 
    ```sh
    ./Ping-Bash.sh
    ```
### Example Output 
    ```sh
    Server 192.168.146.130 is up and Running
    Server 192.168.146.131 is up and Running
    Server 192.168.146.132 is unreachable
    Server 192.168.146.133 is unreachable 
    ```
